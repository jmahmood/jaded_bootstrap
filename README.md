Jaded Bootstrap
---------------

Jade is a very cool templating engine that is included in node.js, with concepts like meaningful spacing and very minor programability [http://jade-lang.com/]

Twitter Bootstrap is an awesome tool for those of us who put together lots of demos at work.

However, it's hard to get excited about wading through a morass of div tags when you are just trying to get a site done.

Sure, Webstorm and Vim are great about helping you find missing div closures, but shouldn't the computer be doing all of that anyway?

Jaded Bootstrap gives you a set of Jade templates that you can use and re-use in your Bootstrap 3+ projects.  Just import it and go!
